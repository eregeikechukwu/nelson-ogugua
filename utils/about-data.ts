  "I’m Nelson Ogugua, a designer who enjoys turning complex ideas into products that are functional, intuitive and easy to use. My work spans UI/UX design, brand identity, and design systems across fintech, AI, edtech, and SaaS products. I started out doing broad design work, which shaped how I think today. I’ve led products end to end, from early concept and strategy to detailed UI, design systems, and launch ready experiences.";

export const aboutStoryData =
  "My journey into design started largely self taught. It began with curiosity, patience, and a strong desire to understand how people interact with products. I studied Geophysics at the Federal University of Technology, Owerri, Nigeria, but along the way I became deeply drawn to design. I started to see design not just as visuals, but as a way to solve real problems.\n\nI began primarily as a brand identity designer and later transitioned into product design. To deepen my understanding of product design, I joined the Interaction Design Foundation, which strengthened how I think about UX and user centered problem solving.\n\nOver time, I grew through different roles and environments. I have worked as a product designer and brand designer across B2B, B2C, SaaS, fintech, design agencies, and edtech companies. Each role shaped me differently. Some taught me how to think about products at a strategic level. Some pushed me to learn more design tools and expand across disciplines. Others pushed me to own product decisions end to end, take responsibility for quality, and defend design choices with clarity.\n\nThese experiences helped me move beyond designing beautiful screens into designing with intention. I learned how to think in systems and how to build work that can scale rather than just look good in isolation. I learned how to listen, how to ask better questions, and how to align business goals with user goals.\n\nI work primarily with Figma for product design, Adobe Illustrator and Adobe Photoshop for brand work, and tools like Notion, Miro and Figjam to support thinking and documentation. I enjoy collaborating closely with teams and turning complex ideas into experiences that users will love.";
